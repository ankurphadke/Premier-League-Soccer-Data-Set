# Premier-League-Soccer-Data-Set

Being a huge soccer fan, I decided to work with a Premier League data set.
Started with some data exploration and studied the impact of various match statistics on the result of the game.

Went on to build regression models to predict the number of goals scored by a given team in a given match. The following results were achieved:

- Linear regression - R^2 of 58%
- Ridge regression - R^2 of 61%
- Random Forest - R^2 of 70%
